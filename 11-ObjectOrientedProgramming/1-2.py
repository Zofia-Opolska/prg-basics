# The Square class represents objects describing a geometric figure (square). 
# Complete the class by adding a method to calculate the perimeter of a square. 
# Then write a program that creates two squares with sides of 4 and 6, respectively. 
# Calculate the areas and perimeters of these squares. Print the results.
